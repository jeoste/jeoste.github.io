## What are we talking about ?

In the world of data, and more globally digitalisation, internet, storage is and always be a hot topic. From floppy disk to CD, to USD stick, to Hard Drive then SSD and NVME, storing information, programs, pictures, music, videos is the real big turn of this century.

Of course, depending your needs, and the era, you might choose one solution to another. USB Stick for an easy way to transport "hot" and light information, as folders, documents or music.
Hard drive as backup for pictures, videos and important information that needs to last years (or decades)

NVME to access quickly the information through your computer for gaming or video editing.

But in the "data world" as know as business data, or companies data this storing system evolved in another way :
How to store the data, but sometimes for minutes, sometimes years, or sometimes temporarily ?
How to decide if, as a company, I'll need it to do analytics or saves transactions...

Budget, management, sort, those questions belong to the technical team, the engineering part, but this technical solution **must** solve a business problems, and for that we need to know more about the company itself.

## The questions to ask

"Where are you going ?" As a first question it's always the most obvious, and sometimes the one we forget, what are the goals of the company that is using his data

If the answer is "we don't know yet but we will see later" then you become almost certain that a database will be choosen.
The reason is simple : database are versatile, not expensive, easily accessible through SQL. The amount of data can be handled with simple index, query optimisation, good architecture and design of the database (DDL).
It requires a bit more engineering to think as a big picture, taking in consideration the whole data from all the applications and the use case of the company, that in this case we can call "business object".

If the company knows exactly what to do, for example the analytical part is important, a data warehouse might be useful. In opposition, but mainly as a complement, DW focus on the analytics and the query parts.

## The solutions to bring

Nothing is black or white, even a combination of DB, DW and DL will have issues
The best solutions is not the most "trendy" or "beautiful" or "used by other companies"
The best solutions is the ones who solve the problems that is appearing with the "Questions to ask" part.

Sure, if the company wants to invest more, even if at this right moment there is no such a strong demands in term of data, improving the infrastructure and combining database for the transactional and data warehouse for the analytical can be a good combination.

Currently on the market, the choice is numerous, database can be in a public cloud, a private cloud or on-premise, in a server room hosted between the wall of the company

But the pay-as-you-go is becoming more popular. Do not pay for $ XXX / month if you only consume $ XX.
