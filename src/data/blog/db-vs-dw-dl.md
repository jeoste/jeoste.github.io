## Introduction

In the world of data and digitalization, storage has always been a critical topic. From floppy disks to CDs, USB sticks, hard drives, SSDs, and NVMe drives, the evolution of storing information—whether programs, pictures, music, or videos—has been one of the defining technological revolutions of this century.

The choice of storage solution depends on your specific needs and the era you're in:
- **USB sticks** for easy transportation of "hot" and lightweight information like folders, documents, or music
- **Hard drives** for backing up pictures, videos, and important information that needs to last years or decades
- **NVMe drives** for quick access to information on your computer for gaming or video editing

However, in the business data world, storage systems have evolved differently. Companies face unique challenges:
- How to store data for minutes, years, or temporarily?
- How to decide whether data is needed for analytics or transaction processing?
- How to balance budget constraints with management and sorting requirements?

These questions belong to the technical team and engineering department, but the technical solution **must** solve business problems. To make the right choice, we need to understand the company's specific needs and objectives.

## Key Questions to Ask

### "Where are you going?"

This is always the most obvious question, yet sometimes the one we forget: **What are the company's goals for using their data?**

If the answer is "We don't know yet, but we'll figure it out later," then you can be almost certain that a **database** will be chosen. Here's why:

- **Databases are versatile** and not expensive
- **Easily accessible** through SQL
- **Manageable data volumes** with simple indexing, query optimization, and good database architecture and design (DDL)
- **Requires engineering effort** to think big-picture, considering all data from applications and company use cases—what we call "business objects"

If the company knows exactly what they want to achieve—for example, if analytics is a priority—a **data warehouse** might be more appropriate. Data warehouses focus primarily on analytics and query performance, often complementing rather than replacing traditional databases.

## Available Solutions

### No One-Size-Fits-All Approach

Nothing is black or white in data architecture. Even combinations of databases, data warehouses, and data lakes will have their challenges. The best solution isn't necessarily the most "trendy," "beautiful," or "used by other companies." The best solution is the one that solves the specific problems identified in the "Questions to Ask" section.

### Strategic Investment Considerations

If a company wants to invest more in infrastructure, even when there isn't an immediate strong demand for data capabilities, combining a **database for transactional processing** with a **data warehouse for analytics** can be an excellent approach.

### Deployment Options

Currently, the market offers numerous choices. Data solutions can be deployed in:
- **Public cloud** environments
- **Private cloud** setups
- **On-premise** infrastructure in company server rooms

**Pay-as-you-go models** are becoming increasingly popular, allowing companies to pay only for what they consume rather than committing to fixed monthly costs.

## Understanding the Three Main Solutions

### 1. Database
**Best for:** Transactional processing, real-time operations, structured data
- **Use cases:** Customer records, order processing, inventory management
- **Characteristics:** ACID compliance, fast read/write operations, structured schema
- **Examples:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server

### 2. Data Warehouse
**Best for:** Analytics, reporting, business intelligence
- **Use cases:** Historical analysis, trend reporting, executive dashboards
- **Characteristics:** Optimized for complex queries, columnar storage, data modeling
- **Examples:** Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Azure Synapse

### 3. Data Lake
**Best for:** Raw data storage, machine learning, exploratory analysis
- **Use cases:** IoT data, log files, unstructured data, data science projects
- **Characteristics:** Schema-on-read, scalable storage, supports multiple data formats
- **Examples:** Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake, Google Cloud Storage

## Making the Right Choice

When choosing between these solutions, consider:

1. **Data Volume:** How much data do you need to store and process?
2. **Data Velocity:** How fast is data being generated and how quickly do you need to access it?
3. **Data Variety:** What types of data are you working with (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)?
4. **Use Case:** Are you primarily doing transactions, analytics, or both?
5. **Budget:** What are your cost constraints and ROI expectations?
6. **Team Expertise:** What skills does your team have?

## Conclusion

The choice between a database, data warehouse, or data lake (or a combination) should be driven by your specific business requirements, not by industry trends. Start by clearly defining your data goals, then select the solution that best addresses those needs while considering your technical capabilities and budget constraints.

Remember: the most expensive or complex solution isn't always the best one. Focus on solving your actual business problems rather than building infrastructure for problems you might have in the future.
