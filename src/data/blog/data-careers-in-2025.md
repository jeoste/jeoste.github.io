# Introduction 

## Part one : The current market

The data industry is still growing, with companies across all sectors looking for (skilled) professionals to help them with their data. Skilled because the current market is not beginner-friendly unfortunately.

With the recents trend in Data, Big Data in 2017 and now AI, more than before, young people are looking for opportunities.

The most incredible market happened just after COVID, but now it's on a long downtrend and there is no sign of reversal as you can see on the graph below :

The depression part is after us, let's focus on the brighter side : software engineering is not data engineering ; USA is not the only country on earth.

## Part two : The mindset of a junior vs a senior

As the title says, being a senior or confirmed developer (at least 3 years experience) is way more easier than a beginner. So as a recent graduate, or currently intern, looking for jobs, or apprenticeship you should focus on what really matters for the companies : solving business problems.

Diplomas, grade, university, certifications, those as "theoritical knowledge", I'm taking the risk of being too extreme but the most problematic things with juniors is there lack of ability to understand the problem the companies are facing.

University people are here to teach you technology, mindset, attitude. Grade are here to validate your skills, same for diplomas and certifications, but if you know perfectly a tool, the definition, the way it works and how to use it, it doesn't matter if you cannot use it for the purpose of the companies' problem(s).

"I know how to code a binary tree using Python" -> Congratulations, but the company wants you to solve this bug into this system that has been maintained for 20 years in order to fill one column in a database that is the current backbone of the entire dashboard for the HR department.

Technical case =/= business use case.

It took me many years to understand this, because most of my colleagues didn't want me to know this, so I could stay in my developer position and not climbing the ladder to a more "consulting" or "managing" role that they were enrolled for.

So as a junior, embrace the business problematic. Use your time to understand, not just how, but why this problem needs to be solved. AI can help you figure out the technical details, but AI doesn't know the context of the business and the client that you have to satisfy.

# Which direction to choose

Where do you start? So many buzzwords are right now used, data science, data engineering, analytics engineer, context engineer, machine learning, ai trainer etc... 
As simple as everything should be, there is 3 big "categories" inside Data, which is already a sub-family of software engineering, itself a subfamily of the big IT/digital family.

## The Three Main Data Career Paths

### 1. **Data Engineering**
**What they do**: Build and maintain data infrastructure, pipelines, and systems.
**Pros**: most resilient, technical, most practical

**Cons**: lots of "fixing stuff", at the end of the chain so always problems solver, very flexible job

- **Focus**: Data infrastructure, ETL/ELT processes, data warehousing
- **Skills**: SQL, Python, cloud platforms, data modeling
- **Typical roles**: Data Engineer, ETL Developer, Data Platform Engineer

### 3. **Data Analytics**
**What they do**: Transform data into actionable business insights and reports.

**Pros**: high level, last person before submitting important dashboards, less technical

**Cons**: less technical so might be replaced by AI, not resilient if too high level (you need to be technical)
- **Focus**: Business intelligence, reporting, dashboard creation
- **Skills**: SQL, Excel, BI tools, data visualization
- **Typical roles**: Data Analyst, Business Analyst, BI Developer

### 2. **Data Science**
**What they do**: Analyze data to extract insights and build predictive models.
**Pros**: data rockstar, latest technologies, high end programming
**Cons**: lots of math, data cleaning will take all your time
- **Focus**: Statistical analysis, machine learning, business insights
- **Skills**: Python/R, statistics, machine learning, data visualization
- **Typical roles**: Data Scientist, ML Engineer, Analytics Engineer

Conclusion : 
- A data analyst can be replaced by a data engineer, data scientist
- A data engineer can be replaced by a data scientist
- A data scientist can be doing everything except data science


# Which Path Should You Choose?

| Factor | Data Engineering | Data Science | Data Analytics |
|--------|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Coding Required** | High | High | Medium |
| **Math/Statistics** | Low | High | Medium |
| **Business Focus** | Medium | Medium | High |
| **Entry Level** | Medium | Hard | Easy |

    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    SUM(amount) as total_spent
FROM orders 
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING total_spent > 1000
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```
